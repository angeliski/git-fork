[WIP] That is a work in progress. Be carefully to use in your projects 

A simple way to manage your forks. You can find some tutorials how to do that, but how about just run a `git-fork sync` and get your repository synchronized?

The `git-fork` is based in a simple idea: You do all your work outside from the main branch, and we sync the main branch when needed 


## Installation
Not done yet. If you would like to try, clone the repo and run `make build` to get a binary

## Develop

You can see the commands run `make help`, here some tips:
- `make quality` -  that command will run all quality checks in your code
- `make mocks` - that command will generate the mocks for all interfaces
